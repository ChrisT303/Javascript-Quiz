This is a quiz I created to test the user's knowledge of Javascript

The quiz conists of 5 mulitple choice questions that will prompt the user if selected answer
is corect or incorrect.

The user has 90 seconds to complete the quiz. If time runs out before all questions are answered the game ends.

For each question answered correctly the user is awarded 20 points, prompted they were correct, and moves to the next question.

For each question answered incorrectly the user is deducted 10 seconds off the clock, prompted they were incorrect, and moves the next question.

At the end of the game a final score is given and the user has an input field to submit their initials. 

If the user made the top 5, thier initials and score and displayed.

If the user fails to enter their initials, they are prompted to do so.

On the final page the Top 5 scores are displayed

If the user elects to try the quiz again, the quiz resets.

If the user elects to clear the scores they are cleared in local storage.
